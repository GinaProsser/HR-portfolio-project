Gina's Check In with Senior People Support Advisor, Razia Khan - 25 September 2025

It was a pleasure to hold a check in with Gina today. 
We have ran through the new objectives and I am pleased to state that Gina has already made a start on some of the objectives. Some of the objectives have come from Gina’s CPD plan which is a great tool for us both to refer to. I will re-visit the objectives with Gina again at the next check in to ensure we are on track and Gina is being supported.
I have noted that Gina has hit the ground running, she is a natural speaker and recently at the ‘CQC Way’ call presented the teams views as requested by Ross Campbell (Resourcing and HR Services Manager) and Gina Georgiou (Deputy Director of People Operations).
Gina’s handling of the call was professional and she was a great representative for the team. In addition, Gina has good relationships with the other teams which we are benefiting from as a team. I have noticed that she has a strong ability in building relationships and this is evident in how she is handling the HR Services/Scheduling calls with Donna (Scheduling Manager) and Kelly (Scheduling Advisor) every fortnight.
I personally enjoy working with Gina, she is inquisitive and passionate about getting things right for the team and department. 
I would like to thank Gina for all her hard work to date and I look forward to working with you and helping you develop your career in HR.
Keep up the hard work Gina! 😊
