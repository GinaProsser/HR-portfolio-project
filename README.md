## 📄 Key Achievements
👉 Streamlined onboarding and lifecycle processes using HR data and Power BI dashboards to reduce case resolution times and to minimise overall onboarding completion timeline. Presented actionable insights to senior stakeholders to evidence team workload levels.

This included developing and embedding clear workflows and responsibilities to improve collaboration, structure and overall team efficiency.

👉 Led wellbeing initiatives within the People Operations Directorate producing a weekly newsletter and embedding a wellbeing focus into team culture to boost engagement and retention.
